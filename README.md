# Booking description

Our site was created so that students and teachers of Ala-Too University could book sports fields online.
(football field, basketball, volleyball field and gym)
On our website you can book a field as soon as possible by selecting the type of field, date and time.

Our site was created on the basis of the Python programming language. (django framework)
css (cascading style sheets) is used for the front end. 
For the database we use sqlite
